- 👋 Hi, I’m @benny9917
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills and trying to understand programming. 
- 🤔 I always thought I was tech savvy but this is so far out of my comfort zone. 
- 🙏 hopefully I can get my head around all this, and who knows where it may lead? New career? Some skills to teach my kids? 
- 🤗 This is all so new and exciting.....let's do it!!
